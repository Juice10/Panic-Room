# Mint Julep

## Ingredients

 - 75ml (100 proof) Bourbon
 - 15ml (rich) simple syrup
 - 6-8 mint leaves
 - 1 mint sprigs
 - powdered sugar
 - crushed ice

## Instructions

Add mint leaves to a Julep Cup (or Collins Glass), bruise the leaves with a muddler. Then add the spirit and syrup. Fill the vessel three-quarters with crushed ice and swizzle or stir for 10 seconds. Top with more crushed ice, garnish with the mint sprig, and serve with a straw. Top off with a couple dashes of powdered sugar to add some nice white coloring on the mint sprig.
